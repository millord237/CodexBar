# CodexBar

Tiny macOS 15+ menu bar app that shows how much Codex usage you have left (5‑hour + weekly windows) and when each window resets. No Dock icon, minimal UI, dynamic bar icon in the menu bar.

- Reads the newest `rollout-*.jsonl` in `~/.codex/sessions/...` and extracts the latest `token_count` event to get `used_percent`, `window_minutes`, and `resets_at`.
- Displays both windows (5h / weekly), last-updated time, your ChatGPT account email + plan (decoded locally from `~/.codex/auth.json`), and a configurable refresh cadence.
- Horizontal bar icon: top bar = 5h window, bottom hairline = weekly window. Filled portion shows “percent left.” Turns dim when the last read failed.
- CLI-only: does not hit chatgpt.com or browsers; keeps tokens on-device.

## Quick start
```bash
swift build -c release          # or debug for development
./Scripts/package_app.sh        # builds CodexBar.app in-place
open CodexBar.app
```

Requirements:
- Codex CLI ≥ 0.55.0 installed and logged in (`codex --version`).
- At least one Codex prompt this session so `token_count` events exist (otherwise you’ll see “No usage yet”).

## Refresh cadence
Menu → “Refresh every …” with presets: Manual, 1 min, 2 min (default), 5 min. Manual still allows “Refresh now.”

## Notarization & signing
Same flow as Trimmy:
```bash
export APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_P8="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
export APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID="ABC123XYZ"
export APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
./Scripts/sign-and-notarize.sh
```
Outputs `CodexBar-0.1.0.zip` ready to ship. Adjust `APP_IDENTITY` in the script if needed.

## How account info is read
`~/.codex/auth.json` is decoded locally (JWT only) to show your email + plan (Pro/Plus/Business). Nothing is sent anywhere.

## Limitations / edge cases
- If the newest session log has no `token_count` yet, you’ll see “No usage yet.” Run one Codex prompt and refresh.
- If Codex changes the event schema, percentages may fail to parse; the menu will show the error string.
- Only arm64 build is scripted; add `--arch x86_64` if you want a universal binary.
